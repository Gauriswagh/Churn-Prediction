# Churn-Prediction
The data set includes information about:

1. Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
2. Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
3. Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
4. General info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.

There are total 7043 rows and 21 columns.

- It is very easy and easily understandable dataset.

- In this project, With the help of Machine Learning algorithms, i gain valuable insights from the data. 

- Here I built and evaluated various models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier Models.  
  And handled the class imbalance problem using SMOTE.

- Each algorithm brought its unique information from the table, and compared their performance to identify the most accurate prediction model 
  using confusion matrix, and Classification Report.

- Here, with the help of visualization it was very helpful to get clear relationship and insights from the data.

- Also, the Feature Importance and Correlation matrix were very helpful, to visualize and understand the data very impact-fully.
